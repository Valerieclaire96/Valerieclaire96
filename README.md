## Hello good people of the internet and beyond 👽 
### Let me introduce myself 🎩
<br>
I am Valerie, jr. developer 💻- rookie chef 👩‍🍳- sr. binge watcher🛋️
<br>
<br>
Some of my current projects are Sims IRL and Donut Shoppe 🍩
<br>

<br>
Donut Shoppe which is an app used for preorder handling for a fictional bakery 🥯
<br>
They are both being built using python, SQLAlchemy, Flask, Fetch, React, and CSS

<br>
📅 My 2023 coding goals are to learn typescript, Node.js, React Native, and Java ☕
