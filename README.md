## Hello good people of the internet and beyond 👽 
### Let me introduce myself 🎩
<br>
I am Valerie, developer 💻- rookie chef 👩‍🍳- binge watcher🛋️
<br>
<br>
Some of my current projects are Order's Ahoy and Goober Games 🍩

Orders Ahoy is a food ordering website made with PHP and MySQL
<br>
Goober Games is a site that has quizzes and small games made with React, JSON, Bootstrap, and CSS.

📅 My 2023 coding goals are to learn typescript, Node.js, React Native, and Java ☕
