Hello good people of the internet and beyond 👽 
I am currently working on Sims IRL which is a site of curated information based on the sims 4 using python, SQLAlchemy, and react 💻
I am curring using free code camp to refine my skills in Javascript and front-end libraries.
👾 In my free time I enjoy playing games such as The Sims and Stardew Valley while enjoying an oversized mug of green tea 🍵 
🐶 I have two wonderful -yet spoiled- dogs who love long walks and big dinners🐶
